# TriviaMazeCSCD350
Trivia maze group project for CSCD350 at Eastern Washington University, Spring 2020. This is a simple text based game that generates a dungeon for the player to traverse. To travel between each room, a trivia question must be answered. If the user answers incorrectly, the door is permanently locked. If there is no path to the maze's exit, the game is lost. Trivia questions are stored in a SQLite database. Accessing the admin menu allows a user to add questions to the database, clear the database, or restore it to its default state. 
More in depth instructions for gameplay can be read in the [tutorial text file.](https://github.com/rdeskins/TriviaMazeCSCD350/blob/master/tutorial.txt)

## Getting Started
This project was created and tested in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The game can be played by running TriviaMazeInstaller.exe and installing the program. An alternative is to download the source code, compile the files, and run TriviaMain.java
